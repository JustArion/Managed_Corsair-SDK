This repo is a managed implementation of the native [iCUE SDK](https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk) which is made by [Corsair](https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk/releases).

Not everything is implemented right now. Upon request or my own interest I might implement more of the SDK.

The SDK is reliant upon the `iCUE.exe` process, the SDK is reliant upon `iCUESDK.x64_2019.dll` and `iCUESDK_2019.dll`
